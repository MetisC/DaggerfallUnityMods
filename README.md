# Dress Code System - Daggerfall Unity Mod

**Dress Code System** is a mod for **Daggerfall Unity** that adds a social and legal clothing system. What you wear (or don’t) finally matters!

## 🎯 What Does It Do?

- 🧾 **Clothing classification**: Detects if you’re dressed like a noble, commoner, warrior… or completely naked.
- 🗺️ **Context-sensitive reactions**: Your outfit matters more in a temple than in a tavern.
- 🚷 **Access restrictions**: Get blocked from certain areas if you're dressed inappropriately.
- 🚨 **Crime system**: Dress offensively in sacred or noble places and the guards may come for you.
- 📉 **Reputation penalties**: Ignoring warnings affects your standing with factions.
- 🗣️ **Ambient and dialogue reactions**: NPCs comment on your attire, and some may refuse to speak with you.
